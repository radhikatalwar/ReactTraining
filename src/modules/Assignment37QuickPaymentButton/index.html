      What is Child Sponsorship? Child sponsorship is one of the best ways to
      give children better lives and futures. Sponsoring a child through World
      Vision India is one of the most effective, inspiring and rewarding ways to
      help children. You’ll be doing much more than helping to meet children's
      basic needs – you’ll be helping to equip them for life. By bringing about
      lasting change in your sponsored child’s community, you’ll also be
      improving the lives of many other vulnerable children. When you sponsor a
      child, you will receive photograph of your sponsored child, information
      about your child, child’s family and community, annual report indicating
      the progress of your child, World Vision India’s magazine Jeevan Sparsh
      and an opportunity to gift, write or visit your sponsored child.
